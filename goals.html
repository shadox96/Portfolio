<!--Before the code and text begins, I would like to start with some background here. I had lost track in class around the time we got to JQuery. Along-side doing this project, I was also doing some self-review, and had managed to catch myself up pretty nicely. But that explains why I haven't been turning assignments in. Now, on with the code! -->

		<h3>My Aspirations</h3>
		<p>My goal in life is to become a game developer. As my dad had mentioned many years past, if I liked games so much, I should learn how to make them.If I were to learn to make these games, I could find myself in a great place in life, should I make a game that's good enough for the public. I could also fall back on web design if necessary, since I am learning many languages for web design as well as program design. Who knows, I could also find myself making AI's and special programs that could be used for the greater good of society. But that is up to the future and myself to decide.</p>
