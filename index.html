<!--Before the code and text begins, I would like to start with some background here. I had lost track in class around the time we got to JQuery. Along-side doing this project, I was also doing some self-review, and had managed to catch myself up pretty nicely. But that explains why I haven't been turning assignments in. Now, on with the code! -->

		<h3>An Introduction</h3>
		<p>To introduce this portfolio, I would like to start by giving you my thanks for taking the time to look over said portfolio. It really means a lot, and I hope that it does well to convince you to allow me to work in your company. My name is Jason Steinhart, and I am an up-and-coming programmer/designer for websites such as this one. This home page will mainly be for this introduction, and the links over to the side will hold some projects I've done in the past. After this segment will be a look into my life, including my personal goals.</p>
