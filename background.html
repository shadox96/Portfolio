<!--Before the code and text begins, I would like to start with some background here. I had lost track in class around the time we got to JQuery. Along-side doing this project, I was also doing some self-review, and had managed to catch myself up pretty nicely. But that explains why I haven't been turning assignments in. Now, on with the code! -->

		<h3> My Background</h3>
		<p>When I was younger, I had no idea what it was that I wanted to do with my life. I <b>did</b> know one thing, though. I was really into science-related topics. I loved chemistry, biology, and the like. I could never really get into physics or mathematics, however. So I had decided that I was going to go into a career in chemistry. Well, college rolled around, and I was already in a position to be a Chem major. For the first semester, I did astoundingly great. But that's where my chemical success had come to a close. The next term roleld around, and somewhere in the middle of the semester, I had lost track of where the class was, and with it, did absolutely horribly. After 3 semesters, I knew it was over for that. So, I had decided to try something else. Something my dad has been trying to tell me to get into for ages. See, there was something else that I loved, probably even more than chemistry. I <b><i>LOVED</i></b> video games. Still do. And for years, my dad was saying "if you like games so much, why do you learn how to program them?" I kept passing it off. But then I had gotten into a C++ class. That class wasn't the best example of what I could do, but it definitely got me into programming.
		</p>

		<h3>More Modern Times</h3>
		<p> After that first C++ class, I wanted to try other programming classes. I had switched my major from chemistry to IIT, and had taken 2 more programming classes the following semester. I had taken another C++ class, and I took an HTML/CSS class. And in these clases, I did phoenominally better than I had with my chemistry and science major classes. As of now, I am taking classes involving JavaScript/JQuery, and another one with Ruby on Rails. Programming has become my passion, but there's still so much more to learn.
