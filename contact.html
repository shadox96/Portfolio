<!--Before the code and text begins, I would like to start with some background here. I had lost track in class around the time we got to JQuery. Along-side doing this project, I was also doing some self-review, and had managed to catch myself up pretty nicely. But that explains why I haven't been turning assignments in. Now, on with the code! -->
